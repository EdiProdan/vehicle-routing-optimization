# vehicle-routing-optimization

## Overview

This project implements a solution for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPWTW) using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The CVRPWTW is a classic optimization problem where a fleet of vehicles is tasked with delivering goods to a set of customers within specified time windows, while respecting vehicle capacity constraints.

## Features

- **Ant Colony Optimization**: Utilizes ACO to find near-optimal solutions for CVRPWTW.
- **Time Windows**: Incorporates time window constraints for each customer, adding an additional layer of complexity to the traditional CVRP.
- **Capacitated Vehicles**: Ensures that the capacity constraints of the vehicles are not violated during the routing process.
- **Easy Integration**: The solution can be easily integrated into existing projects or used as a standalone tool.
